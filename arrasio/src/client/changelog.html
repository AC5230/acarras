      <b>Release 1.3pre1 (Update 121820u1)</b><ul>
  <li>Added Tri-Tank at some point.</li>
  </ul><hr><br>
        <an>we're back</an><ul>
  <li>what</li>
  </ul><hr><br>
        <an>rip acarras, 2018-2019</an><ul>
  <li>Until I get things out regarding my situation due to the fact Internet compatibility on my computer seems to be completly bricked, I have no choice but to declare ACarras, the least active Arras server in the world, <i>de facto</i> abandoned. Thank you for your understanding.</li>
  <li>I'd like to thank all current and former devs for their long and hard work. Except Cupcake. Hellcat did the work for her. Hellcat gets the thanks she would've gotten because, well, yeah. AC out.</li>
  </ul><hr><br>
        <b>Release 1.2.4 (Update 062519u1)</b><an> this is good</an><ul>

  <li>absolutely nothing</li>
  </ul><hr><br>
    <b>Release 1.2.3 (Update 021019u2)</b><an> this is good</an><ul>
  <li>With help from "aaaaaaaaaa" on Discord I got to have 16 upgrades on a single page and I can make more now with ease, making my pages irrellevant and I'm probably 'bout to lose like 200 lines off of my definitions file, because yes.</li>
  </ul><hr><br>
   <b>Release 1.2.2 (Update 021019u1)</b><ul>
  <li>Magician, branching from Basic (more specifically Basic Page 2) at level 45
      <li>it's got the balance of a single but can make pentagons (on the actual shape team) outta thin air by pressing <an>G</an> (1.5 second recharge for this ability)</li>
  </li>
  <li><idea>This idea was made by AC (myself), with code for the ability provided by VarixDog.</idea></li>
  <li>Because of this, beta testers cannot teleport currently, we'll have that fixed ASAP.</li>
  </ul><hr><br>
   <b>Release 1.2.1 (Update 012019u1)</b><ul>

  </ul><hr><br>

  <li>A pentagon with a piece-of-pie shape cut out of the back.</li>
  <li>and the Flash shape/crasher variant:</li>

  <li>The most complicated tank in my server. Jeez louise.</li>
  <li>1.2 will release on Openshift if I can make things work. It'll be deemed the Unglitched Update if things work out, meaning this will soon be discontinued and I will be the only dev.</li>

  <li><idea>The entire branch was my idea. Not. Even. Kidding.</idea></li>
  <li>Ranger got a balance. It's new balance stat, g.ranger, reduced it's reload by 0.3 seconds, and increased it's raw bullet health amount by 0.15 points.</li>

  <li>Quintuplet has been publicized, an optional upgrade from Triplet</li>

  <li>Ran my definitions.js file through<a href="http://beautifier.io"> this thing, called "beautifier.io"</a> (probably the second time i've done that)</li>
    <li>I guess Wither's gonna be your present for this major update.. even know the 1.2 I referred to was originally planned as 1.1 but one of my co-devs screwed it up reeee</li>
  </ul><hr><br>
  <b>Release 1.0.9.1 (Update 101118u1)</b><ul>
  <li><idea>Return of the</idea><an> Ubuntu</an></li>
  </ul><hr><br>
  <b><an>Announcement from head dev AC</an></b><ul>
  <text>Former co-dev Reese, aka CancelX, has been <b>kicked out</b> of the dev team for LEAKING MY TOKEN to like 7 OTHER PEOPLE, most of them not even in the dev team! He didn't care anything much of ACarras either way.
  He thought the token I stored in his server's code (in which he removed me and everyone with the exception of mse (who I hate) from because he probably is looking to screw me over by this point or because I'm worthless or somethin gay) was for use only in that server.
  He HAD access to this server's code (until now) and he could've SEEN IT at one point or another.<br>
  <idea>So good riddance to Reese.</idea></text>
  </ul><hr><br>
